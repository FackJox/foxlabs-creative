<CONTEMPLATOR>
Looking at your request, I need to create a step-by-step blueprint for integrating Payload CMS into your Next.js project, breaking it down into manageable chunks, and then creating prompts for code implementation.

First, I should understand the structure of your current codebase better to ensure the integration steps align with your existing architecture. Let me examine key files to understand the project structure, data models, and component organization.

Based on the specification we've developed and an understanding of how Payload works with Next.js, I'll create a blueprint that covers:
1. Initial Payload setup and configuration
2. Database models for pages, projects, services, etc.
3. Page builder block components
4. Integration with your existing frontend components
5. Media handling with Cloudinary
6. Authentication setup
7. ISR implementation for content fetching

Each chunk should be independently testable and build logically on previous steps.

Ensure all code is properly typed with TypeScript and includes appropriate error handling.
```

### Prompt 3: Global Settings Collection

```
Create the Global Settings collection for our Payload CMS integration. This collection will store site-wide content that appears across multiple pages. We need:

1. Create a GlobalSettings collection in src/collections/GlobalSettings.ts with:
   - Site name field
   - Contact information (email, phone)
   - Social media links (Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, Behance, GitHub)
   - Footer content (copyright, privacy policy, terms of service)
   - Any other global content from the existing site

2. Configure this as a singleton collection (only one instance)

3. Update payload.config.ts to register the GlobalSettings collection

4. Create utility functions in src/lib/globals.ts to:
   - Fetch global settings data
   - Cache the results for better performance

5. Add types in src/types/payload.ts for GlobalSettings

6. Create a basic test to verify the collection works:

Ensure all fields have proper validation and are typed correctly with TypeScript.
```

### Prompt 4: Core Collections (Projects, Services, Team)

```
Implement the core content collections for our Payload CMS integration: Projects, Services, and Team. These will store the main content types for the portfolio site. We need:

6. Add TypeScript types for all collections in src/types/payload.ts

7. Create utility functions in src/lib/data.ts to:
   - Fetch projects by category
   - Get featured projects
   - Fetch services and team members

Ensure all collections have proper validation, slug generation, and TypeScript typing.
```

### Prompt 5: Page Builder Block Types

```
Create the block types for our page builder functionality in Payload CMS. These blocks will allow flexible page composition. We need:

1. Create a base blocks directory at src/blocks/ with an index.ts file that:
   - Exports all block types
   - Provides a common interface for blocks

2. Implement the following block types as separate files:
   - src/blocks/HeroBlock.ts
   - src/blocks/ProjectShowcaseBlock.ts
   - src/blocks/ServiceSectionBlock.ts
   - src/blocks/TeamSectionBlock.ts
   - src/blocks/ContactSectionBlock.ts
   - src/blocks/CustomContentBlock.ts

3. Each block type should:
   - Extend a common Block interface
   - Include a unique blockType field
   - Have properly typed fields matching our specification
   - Include admin UI configuration for a good editing experience

4. Create a utility function at src/lib/blocks.ts that:
   - Provides a way to register block types
   - Has a function to convert CMS block data to props for React components

5. Add TypeScript types for all blocks in src/types/blocks.ts

6. Create a test for each block type to ensure:

   - Contact Section Block
   - Custom Content Block

3. Add proper validation and slug generation:
   - Ensure unique slugs
   - Validate required fields
   - Handle slug conflicts

4. Update payload.config.ts to register the Pages collection

Ensure the collection is properly configured for a good admin experience with clear labels and help text.
```

### Prompt 7: Block Renderer Component

```
Create a Block Renderer component that will render the appropriate React component based on the block type. This is a crucial part of our page builder implementation. We need:

   - Takes a blocks array as a prop
   - Dynamically renders the appropriate component for each block type
   - Passes the block data as props to the component

2. Create a mapping between block types and React components:
   - Hero Block → existing Hero component
   - Project Showcase Block → existing Projects component
   - Service Section Block → existing Services component
   - Team Section Block → existing Team component
   - Contact Section Block → existing Contact component
   - Custom Content Block → new CustomContent component

3. Create a new CustomContent component at src/components/CustomContent.tsx:
   - Renders flexible column layouts based on block data
   - Supports rich text and media in columns
   - Respects column width settings

4. Update any existing components as needed to accept data in the format provided by the CMS

5. Add proper TypeScript typing for all components and props

6. Create a simple test for the BlockRenderer to verify:
   - It renders the correct component for each block type
   - It handles missing or invalid data gracefully
   - It passes props correctly to child components

Ensure all components maintain the existing brutalist design aesthetic and custom cursor functionality.
```

### Prompt 8: Frontend Data Fetching with ISR

   - Error handling for API requests
   - Type-safe data fetching

4. Implement getStaticPaths functionality to:
   - Generate paths for all pages in the CMS
   - Include fallback behavior for new pages

5. Update the layout components to fetch global settings:
