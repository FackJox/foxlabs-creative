# Comprehensive Testing Strategy Implementation Blueprint

## Overview of Testing Implementation Approach

This blueprint outlines a systematic approach to improve test coverage and quality for the RAW/STUDIO portfolio website. The implementation is broken down into six iterations, each with small, manageable steps that build on previous work.

The current coverage metrics (statements: 41.78%, branches: 17.87%, functions: 23.15%, lines: 47.12%) indicate significant gaps that need to be addressed systematically. This plan prioritizes:

1. Building a solid testing foundation
2. Testing critical components first
3. Progressively expanding to integration and E2E tests
4. Continuous review and improvement

## Implementation Steps by Iteration

### Iteration 1: Critical Component Testing Foundation

#### 1.1. Setup Test Infrastructure

```
Create a standardized test utilities file that will be used across all component tests. Include:
1. A custom render function that wraps components with necessary providers (ThemeProvider, CursorProvider)
2. Common user interaction helpers that work with React Testing Library
3. A setupAxe utility for accessibility testing
4. Screen size simulation utilities for responsive tests

The file should be placed in __tests__/utils/test-utils.ts and include proper TypeScript typing.

Ensure the utilities handle common testing patterns like:
- Setting up mock cursor context
- Simulating different viewport sizes
- Checking for accessibility violations

Example structure:
- Custom render function with all providers
- User event setup for interactions
- Accessibility testing setup with jest-axe
- Screen size simulation helpers
- Type definitions for test utilities
```

#### 1.2. Create Mock Data Factory

```
Create a comprehensive mock data factory system for generating test data. The system should:

1. Create a mockDataFactory.ts file in __tests__/fixtures/ directory
2. Include factory functions for all major data types (projects, services, team members)
3. Support generating both minimal and complete data objects
4. Include helper functions to create arrays of mock objects
5. Support overriding specific fields for test-specific scenarios

The factory should be able to generate:
- Complete project objects with all fields populated
- Minimal project objects with only required fields
- Services with varying numbers of process steps
- Team members with different roles and skills

Ensure all mock objects comply with the TypeScript interfaces defined in the project.

Example functions to include:
- createMockProject(overrides?: Partial<Project>): Project
- createMockService(overrides?: Partial<Service>): Service
- createMockTeamMember(overrides?: Partial<TeamMember>): TeamMember
- createMockProjects(count: number, overrides?: Partial<Project>): Project[]
```

- Active link highlighting updates after navigation
- Browser back button navigates to previous page
- Browser forward button navigates forward
- Page transitions animate correctly
- State is preserved when navigating (e.g., filter selections)

Use React Router's memory router for testing navigation without browser.

Test navigation patterns:
- Home → Projects → Project Detail → Back to Projects
- Home → Services → Service Detail → Back to Services
- Projects with filter → Specific Project → Back (should preserve filter)
- Browser history navigation with back/forward
```

### Iteration 5: End-to-End Testing

#### 5.1. Test Core User Journeys (Cypress)

```

```

### Iteration 6: Continuous Improvement

#### 6.1. Create Coverage Improvement Plan

```
Create a script to analyze test coverage reports and generate a prioritized list of untested code. The script should:

1. Parse Jest coverage reports
2. Identify components, functions, and branches with no coverage
3. Sort by importance/usage in the application
4. Generate a prioritized list of items to test

Create the script in:
- scripts/analyze-coverage.js

The script should:
- Read the coverage JSON report from coverage/coverage-final.json
- Calculate coverage percentages by component
- Identify uncovered lines and branches
- Generate a markdown report with prioritized test targets
- Separate the report into high, medium, and low priority sections

Output should include:
- Component name
- File path
- Current coverage percentage
- Number of uncovered lines/branches
- Example test targets with line numbers

The report should be saved to docs/testing/coverage-targets.md and should be structured to guide the next round of test implementations.
```

#### 6.2. Set Up CI Test Automation

```
Create GitHub Actions workflow configuration for automated testing. The workflow should:

1. Run on pull requests and pushes to main branch
2. Set up the Node.js environment
3. Install dependencies
4. Run linting
5. Run unit and integration tests
6. Run end-to-end tests
7. Generate and store coverage reports
8. Fail if coverage decreases significantly

Create the workflow file:
- .github/workflows/test.yml

Configure the workflow to:
- Run on pull requests to main and pushes to main
- Use Node.js 16.x
- Cache dependencies for faster runs
- Install dependencies with npm ci
- Run linting with npm run lint
- Run tests with npm test
- Run E2E tests with npm run test:e2e:headless
- Generate coverage report with npm run test:coverage
- Store coverage reports as artifacts
- Use a GitHub action to comment coverage changes on PRs
- Fail the workflow if coverage decreases by more than 1%

Include appropriate timeout settings and retry logic for potentially flaky tests.
```

#### 6.3. Implement Test Documentation Generation

```
Create a script to automatically generate test documentation from test files. The script should:

1. Parse test files to extract structure and descriptions
2. Generate markdown documentation of test coverage
3. Include examples of how to run specific test suites
4. Track coverage metrics over time

Create the script in:
- scripts/generate-test-docs.js

The script should:
- Scan all test files in the __tests__ directory
- Parse describe and it blocks to extract test structure
- Generate markdown documentation organized by component/feature
- Include code examples of how to run specific tests
- Link to coverage reports
- Track coverage metrics changes over time
- Update the testing README with the latest information

The script should output updated documentation to:
- docs/testing/components/*.md (component-specific docs)
- docs/testing/integration/*.md (integration test docs)
- docs/testing/e2e/*.md (end-to-end test docs)

The documentation should follow the existing structure but include:
- Test descriptions from describe/it blocks
- Examples of how to run specific test suites
- Current coverage metrics
- Notes about test dependencies and mocks
```

## Final Steps: Tying Everything Together

```
Create a centralized test runner script that:

1. Provides a unified interface for running different test types
2. Includes options for filtering tests by component or feature
3. Generates comprehensive reports after test runs
4. Tracks test performance and reliability over time
5. Makes it easy to run the most relevant tests during development

Create the script in:
- scripts/test-runner.js

The script should support:
- Running unit tests for specific components
- Running integration tests for specific features
- Running E2E tests for specific user journeys
- Generating combined coverage reports
- Tracking test performance and flakiness
- Providing a simple CLI interface with helpful options

Update package.json scripts to include:
- "test:component": "node scripts/test-runner.js --type component"
- "test:integration": "node scripts/test-runner.js --type integration"
- "test:e2e": "node scripts/test-runner.js --type e2e"
- "test:all": "node scripts/test-runner.js --type all"
- "test:watch": "node scripts/test-runner.js --watch"
- "test:component:watch": "node scripts/test-runner.js --type component --watch"

The script should be well-documented with help text and examples.
```

This implementation blueprint provides a systematic, iterative approach to implementing a comprehensive testing strategy for the RAW/STUDIO portfolio website. Each step builds on previous work, ensuring continuous progress toward the coverage goals of 80% for statements, branches, functions, and lines.

The approach prioritizes testing core components first, then progressively adds integration and end-to-end tests to verify complete user journeys. The final steps focus on continuous improvement through automated analysis, reporting, and test maintenance.
