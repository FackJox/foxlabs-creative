# RAW/STUDIO Testing Strategy Todo List

## Iteration 1: Critical Component Testing Foundation

- [x] 1.1. Create standardized test utilities file with custom render function, interaction helpers, accessibility testing setup, and responsive utilities
- [x] 1.2. Develop comprehensive mock data factory system with functions for all major data types and support for minimal/complete data generation
- [x] 1.3. Implement Header component test suite verifying rendering, navigation links, mobile menu, responsive behavior, and cursor interactions
- [ ] 1.4. Implement Footer component test suite verifying content rendering, link behavior, cursor interactions, and accessibility compliance
- [ ] 1.5. Create Button component test suite testing all variants, states, click handlers, loading states, and accessibility

## Iteration 2: Project and Service Component Testing

- [ ] 2.1. Implement ProjectCard component test suite verifying rendering with complete/minimal data, image handling, click behavior, and cursor interactions
- [ ] 2.2. Create ProjectList component test suite testing list rendering, empty states, filtering, responsive layout, and animation sequencing
- [ ] 2.3. Implement ServiceCard component test suite verifying rendering with different data variations, icon display, interactions, and accessibility
- [ ] 2.4. Create tests for data fetching hooks to verify loading states, successful data return, error handling, and refetching functionality

## Iteration 3: Interactive Component Testing

- [ ] 3.1. Implement TextInput component test suite verifying rendering, value updates, error states, accessibility, and user interactions
- [ ] 3.2. Create form validation utility tests verifying rules for required fields, email format, length constraints, and compound validation
- [ ] 3.3. Implement ContactForm component test suite testing rendering, validation, submission, success/error states, and accessibility
- [ ] 3.4. Create custom cursor tests verifying provider rendering, hook functionality, cursor text updates, positioning, and accessibility considerations

## Iteration 4: Integration Testing

- [ ] 4.1. Implement Projects page integration tests verifying complete page rendering, data display, filtering, navigation, and loading/error states
- [ ] 4.2. Create Project Detail page integration tests verifying content display, gallery functionality, related projects, and navigation flows
- [ ] 4.3. Implement navigation flow integration tests verifying page transitions, URL updates, history behavior, and state preservation

## Iteration 5: End-to-End Testing

- [ ] 5.1. Create Cypress E2E tests for core project exploration journey from homepage through filtering, selection, and navigation
- [ ] 5.2. Implement Cypress E2E tests for contact form journey verifying validation, submission, success/error states
- [ ] 5.3. Create Cypress accessibility compliance tests for keyboard navigation, focus management, ARIA attributes, and reduced motion preferences

## Iteration 6: Continuous Improvement

- [ ] 6.1. Develop coverage analysis script to identify and prioritize untested code for systematic coverage improvement
- [ ] 6.2. Set up GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing in CI pipeline with coverage reporting and PR feedback
- [ ] 6.3. Create test documentation generation script to automatically produce updated docs from test structure

## Final Steps

- [ ] 7.1. Implement centralized test runner script with unified interface for all test types, filtering, and comprehensive reporting
