# RAW/STUDIO Portfolio Website - Test Status and Next Steps

This document outlines the current status of the test suite and the next steps for improving test coverage and quality.

## 1. Current Test Status

The test suite currently includes:
- 30 test suites
- 243 passing tests
- 0 failing tests

Key tested components include:
- ProjectCard
- ProjectDetail
- ProjectGallery
- WorkPage
- ServiceItem
- ServiceList
- ServiceDetails
- TeamMember
- AnimatedDialog (example component)
- Various UI utility components

## 2. Test Coverage Status

Current coverage status (as of last test run):
- Statements: 44.04% (target: 80%)
- Branches: 20.79% (target: 80%)
- Lines: 49.54% (target: 80%)
- Functions: 26.1% (target: 80%)

Notable coverage achievements:
- ProjectCard: 100% statement and function coverage
- WorkPage: 95% statement coverage
- hooks directory: 91.56% statement coverage, 94.87% line coverage
- lib directory: 97.77% statement coverage, 100% line coverage

## 3. Next Steps for Test Improvement

To improve test coverage and reach the target thresholds, the following areas need focus:

### 3.1 Page Components

- Create tests for HomePage component
- Create tests for ServicesPage component
- Expand tests for AboutPage component

### 3.2 Layout Components

- Implement tests for Header and Footer components
- Add tests for navigation functionality

### 3.3 UI Components

- Prioritize testing of commonly used UI components
- Focus on components with complex user interactions

### 3.4 Effects Components

- Test CustomCursor component
- Test CursorTrail component

### 3.5 Section Components

- Implement tests for ContactSection
- Test form submission behavior

## 4. Implementation Priority

The approach should be to prioritize business-critical components and user-facing functionality first, then expand to utility and helper components:

1. Core business components
2. Page components
3. User interaction components
4. UI utilities
5. Helper functions

## 5. Accessibility Testing Improvements

To improve accessibility test coverage:

1. Add jest-axe tests to all component test suites
2. Test keyboard navigation for interactive components
3. Verify screen reader compatibility
4. Test color contrast and other WCAG requirements

## 6. Integration Test Expansion

Areas for expanding integration testing include:

1. Page transitions and routing
2. Form submission flows
3. Filter and search functionality
4. Animation sequences

## 7. Infrastructure Improvements

Potential improvements to the testing infrastructure:

1. Setup automated visual regression testing
2. Implement E2E test coverage reporting
3. Add performance testing for critical paths
4. Setup cross-browser test automation
