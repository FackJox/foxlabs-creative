# RAW/STUDIO Portfolio Website - Test Status and Next Steps

This document outlines the current status of the test suite and the next steps for improving test coverage and quality.

## 1. Current Test Status

The test suite currently includes:
- 34 test suites (added 4 new layout component test suites)
- 263 passing tests (added 20 new tests for layout components)
- 0 failing tests

Key tested components include:
- ProjectCard
- ProjectDetail
- ProjectGallery
- WorkPage
- ServiceItem
- ServiceList
- ServiceDetails
- TeamMember
- Header
- Footer
- Sidebar
- NavigationMenu
- AnimatedDialog (example component)
- Various UI utility components

## 2. Test Coverage Status

Current coverage status (as of last test run):
- Statements: 52.15% (target: 80%) ↑ from 44.04%
- Branches: 29.36% (target: 80%) ↑ from 20.79%
- Lines: 57.83% (target: 80%) ↑ from 49.54%
- Functions: 35.47% (target: 80%) ↑ from 26.1%

Notable coverage achievements:
- ProjectCard: 100% statement and function coverage
- WorkPage: 95% statement coverage
- Header: 98% statement coverage
- Footer: 100% statement coverage
- hooks directory: 91.56% statement coverage, 94.87% line coverage
- lib directory: 97.77% statement coverage, 100% line coverage

## 3. Next Steps for Test Improvement

To improve test coverage and reach the target thresholds, the following areas need focus:

### 3.1 Page Components

- Create tests for HomePage component
- Create tests for ServicesPage component
- Expand tests for AboutPage component

### 3.2 Layout Components

✅ Implemented tests for Header and Footer components
✅ Added tests for navigation functionality
✅ Added tests for Sidebar component
✅ Added tests for NavigationMenu component
- Add tests for layout wrappers and composition

### 3.3 UI Components

- Prioritize testing of commonly used UI components
- Focus on components with complex user interactions

### 3.4 Effects Components

- Test CustomCursor component
- Test CursorTrail component

### 3.5 Section Components

- Implement tests for ContactSection
- Test form submission behavior

## 4. Implementation Priority

The approach should be to prioritize business-critical components and user-facing functionality first, then expand to utility and helper components:

1. Core business components
2. Page components
3. User interaction components
4. UI utilities
5. Helper functions

## 5. Accessibility Testing Improvements

To improve accessibility test coverage:

1. Add jest-axe tests to all component test suites
   - ✅ Added to Header, Footer, Sidebar, and NavigationMenu tests
2. Test keyboard navigation for interactive components
3. Verify screen reader compatibility
4. Test color contrast and other WCAG requirements

## 6. Integration Test Expansion

Areas for expanding integration testing include:

1. Page transitions and routing
2. Form submission flows
3. Filter and search functionality
4. Animation sequences

## 7. Infrastructure Improvements

Potential improvements to the testing infrastructure:

1. Setup automated visual regression testing
2. Implement E2E test coverage reporting
3. Add performance testing for critical paths
4. Setup cross-browser test automation 

## 8. Recent Improvements (Latest Update)

The following improvements were recently made to the test suite:

1. Added comprehensive tests for all layout components:
   - Header component tests for rendering, menu functionality, and cursor behavior
   - Footer component tests for rendering and responsive behavior
   - Sidebar component tests for collapsible behavior and content rendering
   - NavigationMenu component tests for dropdown functionality and links
2. Improved accessibility testing by adding jest-axe tests to all layout components
3. Added documentation for layout component testing
4. Created test examples for cursor text behavior on interactive elements
