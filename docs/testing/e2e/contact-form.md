# Contact Form End-to-End Tests

This document outlines the end-to-end testing approach for the contact form user flow on the FoxLabs//Creative portfolio website.

## Overview

End-to-end tests for the contact form simulate complete user interactions with the form, from initial page load to form submission and response handling. These tests verify that the entire contact flow functions correctly in an environment that closely resembles production.

## Test Scenarios

### Basic Form Submission Flow

Tests the complete flow of a user successfully submitting the contact form:

1. User navigates to the contact section of the website
2. User fills out all required fields with valid data
3. User submits the form
4. User receives a success confirmation message

### Form Validation Flow

Tests the validation feedback loop:

1. User navigates to the contact section
2. User attempts to submit an incomplete form
3. User receives validation errors
4. User corrects the errors
5. User successfully submits the form

### Error Handling Flow

Tests the system's response to server errors:

1. User navigates to the contact section
2. User fills out the form correctly
3. Server returns an error during submission
4. User receives an appropriate error message
5. User has the opportunity to resubmit

## Test Implementation

E2E tests utilize:

- Cypress or Playwright for browser automation
- Mocked API responses to simulate various server states
- Visual regression testing to ensure form UI remains consistent

## Test Data

Tests use:

- A variety of valid and invalid form inputs
- Different device viewport sizes to test responsive behavior
- Simulated network conditions (fast, slow, disconnected)

## Accessibility Verification

E2E tests also verify accessibility in the context of the complete user journey:

- Screen reader announcements for form state changes
- Keyboard navigation through the entire form workflow
- Focus management after form submission

*Note: This documentation will be expanded as E2E tests are implemented for the contact form flow.*
