# Project End-to-End Tests

This document provides detailed information about the end-to-end tests for project-related features in the RAW/STUDIO portfolio website.

## Overview

The project end-to-end tests verify the complete user journey of exploring and interacting with projects on the website. These tests ensure that all project-related features work correctly and provide a good user experience.

## Test Files

The project E2E tests are split into three main files:

1. `project-interactions.cy.ts` - Tests for user interactions with project list and detail views
2. `project-data.cy.ts` - Tests for data loading, error states, and data validation
3. `project-accessibility.cy.ts` - Tests for accessibility features and compliance

## Test Coverage

### 1. Project List View Tests

The project list view tests verify the following functionality:

#### Project Grid Display
- Verifies that projects are displayed in a grid layout
- Checks that each project card contains required elements:
  - Project image
  - Project title
  - Project category
  - Project year
- Ensures proper spacing and layout of project cards

#### Category Filtering
- Tests the category filter functionality
- Verifies that filtering reduces the number of displayed projects
- Ensures that filtered projects match the selected category
- Tests clearing the category filter
- Verifies that all projects are shown after clearing the filter

### 2. Project Detail View Tests

The project detail view tests verify the following functionality:

#### Navigation and Content
- Tests navigation to project detail pages
- Verifies URL structure includes project ID
- Checks that all required project information is displayed:
  - Project title
  - Project category
  - Project year
  - Project description
  - Project challenge
  - Project solution
  - Project results

#### Gallery Functionality
- Verifies gallery display and navigation
- Tests next/previous image navigation
- Ensures gallery images are properly displayed
- Verifies image transitions and animations

#### Testimonials
- Tests display of project testimonials when available
- Verifies testimonial content structure:
  - Quote
  - Author
  - Role
  - Company

#### External Links
- Tests external project links
- Verifies links open in new tabs
- Ensures proper security attributes are set

### 3. Data Loading and Error States

The data loading tests verify the following functionality:

#### Loading States
- Tests loading indicators during data fetching
- Verifies loading states for both list and detail views
- Ensures smooth transitions between loading and loaded states

#### Error Handling
- Tests API error scenarios
- Verifies error messages are displayed
- Tests retry functionality
- Ensures graceful handling of non-existent projects

#### Data Validation
- Tests handling of malformed project data
- Verifies handling of missing optional fields
- Ensures required fields are present
- Tests data type validation

### 4. Accessibility Features

The accessibility tests verify the following functionality:

#### Semantic Structure
- Tests proper heading hierarchy
- Verifies ARIA landmarks
- Ensures semantic HTML elements are used correctly

#### Screen Reader Support
- Tests ARIA labels and roles
- Verifies image alt text
- Tests dynamic content announcements
- Ensures proper form control labels

#### Keyboard Navigation
- Tests keyboard navigation through project cards
- Verifies focus management
- Tests focus trapping in modals
- Ensures proper tab order

#### Reduced Motion
- Tests reduced motion support
- Verifies animation alternatives
- Ensures transitions respect user preferences

## Test Data

The tests use the following data sources:

1. Mock API Responses
   - Success responses with valid project data
   - Error responses for testing error states
   - Malformed data for testing validation

2. Test Fixtures
   - Project data fixtures in `__tests__/fixtures/`
   - Mock data utilities in `src/mocks/`

## Running the Tests

To run the project E2E tests:

```bash
# Run all project tests
npm run test:e2e -- --spec "cypress/e2e/project-*.cy.ts"

# Run specific test file
npm run test:e2e -- --spec "cypress/e2e/project-interactions.cy.ts"
```

## Best Practices

1. Test Organization
   - Group related tests using `describe` blocks
   - Use clear, descriptive test names
   - Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern

2. Data Management
   - Use fixtures for consistent test data
   - Mock API responses appropriately
   - Clean up test data after each test

3. Accessibility Testing
   - Test with screen readers
   - Verify keyboard navigation
   - Check ARIA attributes
   - Test reduced motion support

4. Error Handling
   - Test both success and error paths
   - Verify error messages are clear
   - Test recovery mechanisms

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. Flaky Tests
   - Use proper waiting strategies
   - Add appropriate timeouts
   - Handle dynamic content carefully

2. Test Data Management
   - Use isolated test data
   - Clean up after tests
   - Mock external dependencies

3. Accessibility Testing
   - Use proper ARIA attributes
   - Test with assistive technologies
   - Verify keyboard navigation

## Future Improvements

1. Test Coverage
   - Add more edge cases
   - Improve error state coverage
   - Add performance tests

2. Test Organization
   - Split tests into smaller files
   - Add more shared test utilities
   - Improve test documentation

3. Accessibility
   - Add more screen reader tests
   - Improve keyboard navigation tests
   - Add color contrast tests
